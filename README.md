# Show Custom ID

A [Powercord](https://powercord.dev/) plugin that shows Custom IDs below message components when hovering over them, which would otherwise be completely hidden to the user.

Works for message components like Action Buttons and Select Menus.

Probably only useful for bot developers and the sort.
